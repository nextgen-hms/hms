# 🏥 Hospital Management System (HMS)

> **A State-of-the-Art, Data-First Healthcare Management Platform**

HMS is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade **Hospital Management System** built with **Next.js 15** and **PostgreSQL**. Designed for modern healthcare facilities, it streamlines patient registration, clinical consultations, pharmacy inventory, and laboratory workflows with a focus on data integrity, type safety, and visual excellence.

## 🚀 Project Vision

Our mission is to provide a robust, high-performance digital backbone for healthcare providers. HMS replaces fragmented systems with a unified, **database-driven architecture** that ensures clinical accuracy and operational efficiency. By leveraging modern web standards and deep PostgreSQL logic, we deliver a system that is as reliable as it is simple to use.
